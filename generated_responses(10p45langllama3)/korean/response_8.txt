**Dreams Become Reality**

It started with small things. A child dreamed of having a new bike, and the next morning, it was parked in their front yard. A young couple dreamed of having a romantic dinner at a fancy restaurant, and when they woke up, the table was set with candles and flowers. At first, people thought it was just a coincidence, but as the days went by, the phenomenon became more frequent and widespread.

As the news spread, people began to realize that their dreams were not just random fantasies, but actual predictions of what was to come. A businessman dreamed of making a huge profit on the stock market, and the next day, his investments skyrocketed. A musician dreamed of writing a hit song, and the next day, it was playing on the radio.

But not all dreams were pleasant. A person dreamed of losing their job, and the next day, they received a pink slip. A family dreamed of their house being burglarized, and the next day, they woke up to find their valuables stolen.

As the world descended into chaos, a young woman named Ji-Hyun emerged as a hero. She had the ability to control her dreams, to shape them into reality. She used her powers to help those in need, to prevent disasters and crimes. She became known as the "Dreamweaver," and people began to look up to her as a symbol of hope.

But Ji-Hyun's powers came with a price. She was constantly exhausted, constantly drained by the effort of controlling her dreams. And as she delved deeper into the world of dreams, she began to realize that there was more to reality than what she could see and touch.

There were forces at work, forces that manipulated and controlled the dreams of others. Forces that Ji-Hyun couldn't understand, couldn't control. And as she struggled to comprehend the true nature of reality, she began to wonder: what
