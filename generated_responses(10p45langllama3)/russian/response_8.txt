In the world where every dream became a reality, the first few days were filled with excitement and wonder. People woke up to find that their wildest fantasies had come to life. A young boy's dream of having a giant water slide in his backyard became a reality, and he spent the morning sliding down it with his friends. A couple's dream of having a romantic beach vacation in Hawaii became a reality, and they spent the day lounging on the beach, sipping cocktails and watching the sunset.

She had dreamed of a beautiful garden, and it had become a reality, filling her backyard with flowers and trees that seemed to bloom and grow before her very eyes.
