Dat's a crazy idea, but let's see where it take us. 

In dis world, people wake up every mornin' to find dat deir dreams from da night before have come true. At first, it's like a dream come true (no pun intended). People are livin' da life dey always wanted. 

But den, tings start to get outta hand. People start dreamin' crazy tings, like buildin' giant roller coasters in deir backyards or havin' armies of robots doin' deir chores. Some people even start dreamin' about killin' each oda, and suddenly, dey're facin' off in battles all over da world.

Governments try to figure out how to control dis new reality, but it's like tryin' to herd cats. Dey can't even keep track of who's dreamin' what. Some people start dreamin' about buildin' giant walls to keep out da chaos, but den, dey're stuck inside dem walls, wonderin' how to get out.

As tings get more and more crazy, people start to lose deir grip on reality. Dey start to question what's real and what's just a dream. Some people start to think dat dey're livin' in a never-endin' dream, and dat dey'll never wake up.

One group of people, call demselves "The Dreamwalkers," decide to take matters into deir own hands. Dey're a group of people who've learned how to control deir dreams, and dey're determined to use dis power to bring order back to da world.

Deir leader, a young woman named Maya, has a vision of a world where people can live in harmony with each oda's dreams. She believes dat if dey can just learn to control deir dreams, dey can create a reality where everyone's happy and safe.

But, as Maya and da Dreamwalkers start to make progress, dey realize dat dey're facin' a new challenge: da "Nightmares." Dey're da dark side of da dreams, da tings dat people don't want to face. And dey're gettin' stronger by da day.

Maya and da Dreamwalkers know dat dey have to stop da Nightmares before it's too late. But, as dey face off against da darkness, dey realize dat da line between reality and dreams is gettin' thinner and thinner. And dey're not sure if dey'll be able to tell da difference.

So, dat's da story so far. What you tink happens next?
