(Wind, Ocean, and Mountains sit together on a rocky cliff, watching the sunset)

Wind: "Yo, Ocean, Mountains, me see you guys look same same, but me know you change much over time."

Ocean: "Yeah, Wind, me too. Me remember when me was just a small sea, and now me cover whole earth. Me see islands rise and fall, and me feel the pain of losing me friends."

Mountains: "Aye, Ocean, me feel you. Me too see much change. Me used to be just a small hill, but now me stand tall and proud. Me see the seasons come and go, and me feel the weight of the world on me shoulders."

Wind: "Dat's true, Mountains. Me feel the same way. Me used to be just a gentle breeze, but now me blow strong and fierce. Me see the trees sway and the flowers bloom, and me feel the joy of bringing life to the world."

Ocean: "Yeah, Wind, me know what you mean. Me too feel the joy of bringing life to the world. Me see the fish swim and the coral grow, and me feel the beauty of the underwater world."

Mountains: "Aye, Ocean, me agree. Me too see the beauty of the world. Me see the sun rise and set, and me feel the peace of the morning dew. Me see the snow fall and the rivers flow, and me feel the wonder of the natural world."

Wind: "Dat's da spirit, Mountains and Ocean! Me love seeing da changes in da world. Me feel like me part of somethin' bigger than meself."

Ocean: "Yeah, Wind, me too. Me feel like me connected to everything and everyone. Me know we all part of da same big picture."

Mountains: "Aye, Ocean and Wind, me agree. Me feel like me connected to da earth and da sky. Me know we all part of da same big family."

(All three sit in silence for a moment, watching the sunset)

Wind: "You know, Ocean and Mountains, me think we should have a party to celebrate da changes we see in da world."

Ocean: "Yeah, Wind, dat's a great idea! Me love parties!"

Mountains: "Aye, Wind, me too! Me love music and dancing under da stars."

Wind: "Okay, den! Me invite all da elements to da party. Me invite da sun, da moon, da stars, and da trees. Me invite da fish and da coral, and da birds and da bees. Me invite da whole world to come and celebrate da changes we see!"

Ocean: "Yeah, Wind, dat's da spirit! Me can't wait to see da party!"

Mountains: "Aye, Wind, me too! Me ready to dance under da stars!"

(All three laugh and continue watching the sunset, planning their party)
